# Web-Design-Challenge

This is a repo is for the UTBootCamp homework on HTML and CSS. I used images in the original repo to create a website that analyzed city latitude and various aspects of weather - wind speed, cloudiness, humidity, and temperature. I themed this with the aurora borealis, as in discussing each weather aspect in regard to whether this would help us plan a better trip to see the aurora borealis. There are links to each of the other webpages at the top of each page, as well as links in the body of the home page.
